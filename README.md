# -Exploring-Convolutional-Layers-Through-Data-and-Experiments
In this course, neural networks are not treated as black boxes but as architectural components whose design choices affect performance, scalability, and interpretability. This assignment focuses on convolutional layers as a concrete example of how inductive bias is introduced into learning systems.
